# StevenLacks.com Rebuild

I'm rebuilding my personal website, figured I'd do it openly with the repo here. I'm using React-Router-V7 (n√©e Remix) as a FullStack/Backend-For-Frontend framework. I am not advocating the adoption of RRv7 as a fullstack framework, but I thought it would be fun to see if I could build the full app as a true fullstack where it handles everything but the persistence.
